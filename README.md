# Coat of Arms or Original Design
In this assignment you will create a design of your own choosing, perhaps a coat of arms or some interesting logo, using the Processing programming environment. You may find this [PowerPoint presentation helpful](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ro9qABH9J40NqCaEoC7unQJHbDv01JfChB1pCEgSxWA/edit?usp=sharing) as well as the [grey scale](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tQzDoJDYdGWh1FpHLGUCW1ivMkbhRFXc) 

Your program will use a variety of the Processing graphics functions. Your project will need to incorporate at least one of each of the 2D drawing primitives ([see the Processing API page here](https://processing.org/reference/)) and look for 2D Primitives.

Your project will also define four functions:
* void setup()
* void draw()
* At least two of your own custom functions

Finally, your project will need to include a dynamic component, either an animation or a rotation.

Advanced features:
* Using other drawing API beyond 2D primitives.
* Using advanced color effects like alpha for opacity effects (like ghosting).


## Steps to complete this assignment:
You've already accepted this assignment on github. The next step is to clone the assignment to your laptop.
Clone the repository, just like you did for the Portfolio and Think-Java.

* **Start the Sublime** program and choose File | Open Folder then browse to and open the coat-of-arms folder.
* **Modify index.html** to personalize the title, headline and footer and save your changes by choosing File | Save
* **Launch Processing** (if it isn't already running)
  * This next step may seem odd, so hold tight.
  * From Processing, **Open** the coat-of-arms.pde file. Do this by, browsing to coat-of-arms project, this directory also contains a "coat-of-arms" directory.
    * So ... apcs\java\coat-of-arms\coat-of-arms\coat-of-arms.pde
  * There should be an empty coat-of-arms.pde file in this directory.
  * This will be the file you edit and check in when you are finished.
* Create your masterpiece.
* git add .
  * best to do this at the ROOT of your project directory
* git commit -m "My first processing project"
* git push.
* After you have pushed your code, publish your github project. 
* Finally, update your portfolio to reflect your finished project.
