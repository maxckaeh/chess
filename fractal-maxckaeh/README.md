Create Your Own Fractal
===============

In this assignment you will create your own original fractal design. You can create  fractals with circles, squares, polygons or any other shape. You may want to search the web for ideas, or try to come up with your own variation. Vi Hart has an excellent youtube video [Infinity Elephants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK5Z709J2eo) which describes many similar fractals. You may find slides 120 - 130 of the [Recursion presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NXEZ33kT7R3oAP_08DrrYAJC7jL-b5btSvkuzRGwCOs) helpful (see slide 57 on for ideas). Your program doesn't have to look or work like any other, have fun and be creative.

Requirements:
* Use recursion to draw a fractal shape.
* I'd like you project to incorporate some dynamic components, for example, mouse placement changes the drawing or the fractal animates over time.
